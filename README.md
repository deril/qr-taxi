To run the site on you local machine do the following steps:

    ```
    npm intstall
    ```

2.  Create the `.env` file. You can use `.env.dummy` as an example.

3.  Run a script which installs postgresql to your local machine and
    creates a user/database:

    ```bash
    ./pgsetup.sh
    ```
